## Walkthrough
The pull request makes a minor documentation adjustment by removing an extra newline at the end of the "References" section in the RNA structure refinement markdown file. There are no changes to the content, structure, or functionality of the document.

## Poem
> In the quiet of code, I softly tap away,  
> A tiny newline removed to brighten the day.  
> With whiskers twitching and ears held high,  
> I hop through changes under a digital sky.  
> A little fix from this clever rabbit, hooray!

🪧 Tips

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=ImmortalDemonGod/RNA_PREDICT&utm_content=50):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit , please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
