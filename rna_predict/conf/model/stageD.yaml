# rna_predict/conf/model/stageD.yaml
# Main configuration file for Stage D that includes both diffusion and input features

defaults:
  - _self_
  - stageD_diffusion
  - stageD_input_features

# This file is a placeholder to satisfy the Hydra config structure.
# The actual configuration is in stageD_diffusion.yaml and stageD_input_features.yaml.
# All overrides should be done via CLI or dedicated override files, not here.
