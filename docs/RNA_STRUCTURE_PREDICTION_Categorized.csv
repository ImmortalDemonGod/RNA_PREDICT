"Accurate RNA 3D structure prediction using
a language model-based deep learning
approach","Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures remains
an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for
understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug
development and synthetic biology design. The structural fexibility of RNA,
which leads to the scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates
computational prediction eforts. Here we present RhoFold+, an RNA
language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D
structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA
language model pretrained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging
techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ ofers a fully automated
end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective
evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate
the superiority of RhoFold+ over existing methods, including human
expert groups. Its efcacy and generalizability are further validated
through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored
benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and
interhelical angles, providing empirically verifable features that broaden its
applicability to RNA structure and function studies.",Deep Learning-based Prediction; RNA 3D Structure Prediction; Computational Methods; Language Model Applications; Automated Pipeline
"Abundance of correctly folded RNA motifs in
sequence space, calculated on computational grids","Although functional RNA molecules are known to be

biased in overall composition, the effects of back-
ground composition on the probability of finding a

particular active site by chance has received little
attention. The probability of finding a particular

motif has important implications both for under-
standing the distribution of functional RNAs in

ancient and modern organisms with varying genome
compositions and for tuning SELEX pools to optimize
the chance of finding specific functions. Here we
develop a new method for calculating the probability
of finding a modular motif containing base-paired
regions, and use a computational grid to fold several

hundred million random RNA sequences contain-
ing the core elements of the isoleucine aptamer and

the hammerhead ribozyme to estimate the probability

that a sequence containing these structural ele-
ments will fold correctly when isolated from back-
ground sequences of different compositions. We

find that the two motifs are most likely to be found
in distinct regions of compositional space, and that
the regions of greatest abundance are influenced by
the probability of finding theconserved bases, finding
the flanking helices, and folding, in that order of
importance. Additionally, we can refine our estimates
of the number of random sequences required for a
50% probability of finding an example of each site
in unbiased random pools of length 100 to 4.1 3 109
for the isoleucine aptamer and 1.6 3 1010 for the
hammerhead ribozyme. These figures are consistent
with the facile recovery of these motifs from SELEX
experiments.",RNA Motif Analysis; Computational Probability Modeling; Sequence Composition Studies; Functional RNA Discovery; SELEX Optimization and Analysis
Accelerated protein structure comparison using TM-score-GPU,"Motivation: Accurate comparisons of different protein structures
play important roles in structural biology, structure prediction and
functional annotation. The root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) after
optimal superposition is the predominant measure of similarity due
to the ease and speed of computation. However, global RMSD is
dependent on the length of the protein and can be dominated by
divergent loops that can obscure local regions of similarity. A more
sophisticated measure of structure similarity, Template Modeling
(TM)-score, avoids these problems, and it is one of the measures
used by the community-wide experiments of critical assessment
of protein structure prediction to compare predicted models with
experimental structures. TM-score calculations are, however, much
slower than RMSD calculations. We have therefore implemented
a very fast version of TM-score for Graphical Processing Units
(TM-score-GPU), using a new and novel hybrid Kabsch/quaternion
method for calculating the optimal superposition and RMSD that
is designed for parallel applications. This acceleration in speed
allows TM-score to be used efficiently in computationally intensive

applications such as for clustering of protein models and genome-
wide comparisons of structure.

Results: TM-score-GPU was applied to six sets of models from
Nutritious Rice for the World for a total of 3 million comparisons.
TM-score-GPU is 68 times faster on an ATI 5870 GPU, on average,
than the original CPU single-threaded implementation on an AMD
Phenom II 810 quad-core processor.

"Vfold2D-MC: A physics-based hybrid model for predicting RNA
secondary structure folding","Accurate prediction of RNA structure and folding stability has a far-reaching impact on our
understanding of RNA functions. Here we develop Vfold2D-MC, a new physics-based model, to
predict RNA structure and folding thermodynamics from the sequence. The model employs virtual
bond-based coarse-graining of RNA backbone conformation and generates RNA conformations
through Monte Carlo sampling of the bond angles and torsional angles of the virtual bonds.
Using a coarse-grained statistical potential derived from the known structures, we assign each
conformation with a statistical weight. The weighted average over the conformational ensemble
gives the entropy and free energy parameters for the hairpin, bulge, and internal loops, and
multi-way junctions. From the thermodynamic parameters, we predict RNA structures, melting
curves, and structural changes from the sequence. Theory-experiment comparisons indicate that
Vfold2D-MC not only gives improved structure predictions but also enables the interpretation
of thermodynamic results for different RNA structures, including multibranched junctions.
This new model sets a promising framework to treat more complicated RNA structures, such
as pseudoknotted and intramolecular kissing loops, for which experimental thermodynamic
parameters are often unavailable.",RNA Secondary Structure Prediction; Physics-Based Computational Modeling; Thermodynamic Analysis; Monte Carlo Sampling Methods; Coarse-Grained Modeling
"Structure and stability of RNA/RNA kissing complex:
with application to HIV dimerization initiation signal","We develop a statistical mechanical model to predict the structure and folding stability of the RNA/RNA kissing-loop complex.
One of the key ingredients of the theory is the conformational entropy for the RNA/RNA kissing complex. We employ the
recently developed virtual bond-based RNA folding model (Vfold model) to evaluate the entropy parameters for the different
types of kissing loops. A benchmark test against experiments suggests that the entropy calculation is reliable. As an application
of the model, we apply the model to investigate the structure and folding thermodynamics for the kissing complex of the HIV-1
dimerization initiation signal. With the physics-based energetic parameters, we compute the free energy landscape for the HIV-1
dimer. From the energy landscape, we identify two minimal free energy structures, which correspond to the kissing-loop dimer
and the extended-duplex dimer, respectively. The results support the two-step dimerization process for the HIV-1 replication
cycle. Furthermore, based on the Vfold model and energy minimization, the theory can predict the native structure as well as
the local minima in the free energy landscape. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) for the predicted kissing-loop dimer
and extended-duplex dimer are ~3.0 A ̊ . The method developed here provides a new method to study the RNA/RNA kissing
complex.

"Vfold: A Web Server for RNA Structure and Folding
Thermodynamics Prediction","Background: The ever increasing discovery of non-coding RNAs leads to unprecedented demand for the accurate modeling
of RNA folding, including the predictions of two-dimensional (base pair) and three-dimensional all-atom structures and
folding stabilities. Accurate modeling of RNA structure and stability has far-reaching impact on our understanding of RNA
functions in human health and our ability to design RNA-based therapeutic strategies.
Results: The Vfold server offers a web interface to predict (a) RNA two-dimensional structure from the nucleotide sequence,
(b) three-dimensional structure from the two-dimensional structure and the sequence, and (c) folding thermodynamics
(heat capacity melting curve) from the sequence. To predict the two-dimensional structure (base pairs), the server generates
an ensemble of structures, including loop structures with the different intra-loop mismatches, and evaluates the free
energies using the experimental parameters for the base stacks and the loop entropy parameters given by a coarse-grained
RNA folding model (the Vfold model) for the loops. To predict the three-dimensional structure, the server assembles the
motif scaffolds using structure templates extracted from the known PDB structures and refines the structure using all-atom
energy minimization.
Conclusions: The Vfold-based web server provides a user friendly tool for the prediction of RNA structure and stability. The
web server and the source codes are freely accessible for public use at ‘‘http://rna.physics.missouri.edu’’.

The building blocks and motifs of RNA architecture,"RNA motifs can be defined broadly as recurrent structural elements containing multiple
intramolecular RNA–RNA interactions, as observed in atomic-resolution RNA structures. They
constitute the modular building blocks of RNA architecture, which is organized hierarchically.
Recent work has focused on analyzing RNA backbone conformations to identify, define and
search for new instances of recurrent motifs in X-ray structures. One current view asserts that
recurrent RNA strand segments with characteristic backbone configurations qualify as independent
motifs. Other considerations indicate that, to characterize modular motifs, one must take into
account the larger structural context of such strand segments. This follows the biologically relevant
motivation, which is to identify RNA structural characteristics that are subject to sequence
constraints and that thus relate RNA architectures to sequences.",RNA Structural Motifs; Modular RNA Architecture; Backbone Conformation Analysis; Sequence-Structure Relationships; Structural Biology of RNA
"TMQuery: a database of precomputed template

tionally expensive measure of protein similarity that is applicable to a wide variety of structural biology problems.

"The non-Watson±Crick base pairs and their
associated isostericity matrices","RNA molecules exhibit complex structures in which

a large fraction of the bases engage in non-
Watson±Crick base pairing, forming motifs that

mediate long-range RNA±RNA interactions and
create binding sites for proteins and small molecule

ligands. The rapidly growing number of three-
dimensional RNA structures at atomic resolution

requires that databases contain the annotation of
such base pairs. An unambiguous and descriptive
nomenclature was proposed recently in which
RNA base pairs were classi®ed by the base edges
participating in the interaction (Watson±Crick,
Hoogsteen/CH or sugar edge) and the orientation of
the glycosidic bonds relative to the hydrogen bonds
(cis or trans). Twelve basic geometric families were
identi®ed and all 12 have been observed in crystal
structures. For each base pairing family, we present
here the 4 3 4 `isostericity matrices' summarizing
the geometric relationships between the 16 pairwise
combinations of the four standard bases, A, C, G
and U. Whenever available, a representative
example of each observed base pair from X-ray
crystal structures (3.0 AÊ resolution or better) is
provided or, otherwise, theoretically plausible
models. This format makes apparent the recurrent
geometric patterns that are observed and helps
identify isosteric pairs that co-vary or interchange
in sequences of homologous molecules while
maintaining conserved three-dimensional motifs.",Non-Watson–Crick Base Pairing; RNA Structural Annotation; Isostericity Matrices; Geometric RNA Base-Pair Analysis; 3D RNA Structure Databases
"RNAMotifScanX: a graph alignment approach for RNA
structural motif identification","RNA structural motifs are recurrent three-dimensional (3D) components found in the RNA architecture. These RNA structural
motifs play important structural or functional roles and usually exhibit highly conserved 3D geometries and base-interaction
patterns. Analysis of the RNA 3D structures and elucidation of their molecular functions heavily rely on efficient and accurate
identification of these motifs. However, efficient RNA structural motif search tools are lacking due to the high complexity of
these motifs. In this work, we present RNAMotifScanX, a motif search tool based on a base-interaction graph alignment
algorithm. This novel algorithm enables automatic identification of both partially and fully matched motif instances.
RNAMotifScanX considers noncanonical base-pairing interactions, base-stacking interactions, and sequence conservation of
the motifs, which leads to significantly improved sensitivity and specificity as compared with other state-of-the-art search
tools. RNAMotifScanX also adopts a carefully designed branch-and-bound technique, which enables ultra-fast search of large
kink-turn motifs against a 23S rRNA. The software package RNAMotifScanX is implemented using GNU C++, and is freely
available from http://genome.ucf.edu/RNAMotifScanX.

"RNAdegformer: accurate prediction of mRNA
degradation at nucleotide resolution with deep learning","Messenger RNA-based therapeutics have shown tremendous potential, as demonstrated by the rapid development of messenger RNA
based vaccines for COVID-19. Nevertheless, distribution of mRNA vaccines worldwide has been hampered by mRNA’s inherent thermal
instability due to in-line hydrolysis, a chemical degradation reaction. Therefore, predicting and understanding RNA degradation is a
crucial and urgent task. Here we present RNAdegformer, an effective and interpretable model architecture that excels in predicting
RNA degradation. RNAdegformer processes RNA sequences with self-attention and convolutions, two deep learning techniques that
have proved dominant in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, while utilizing biophysical features of RNA.
We demonstrate that RNAdegformer outperforms previous best methods at predicting degradation properties at nucleotide resolution
for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. RNAdegformer predictions also exhibit improved correlation with RNA in vitro half-life compared with
previous best methods. Additionally, we showcase how direct visualization of self-attention maps assists informed decision-making.
Further, our model reveals important features in determining mRNA degradation rates via leave-one-feature-out analysis.

"RNADiffFold: generative RNA secondary structure
prediction using discrete diffusion models","Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are essential macromolecules that perform diverse biological functions in living beings. Precise
prediction of RNA secondary structures is instrumental in deciphering their complex three-dimensional architecture and functionality.
Traditional methodologies for RNA structure prediction, including energy-based and learning-based approaches, often depict RNA
secondary structures from a static perspective and rely on stringent a priori constraints. Inspired by the success of diffusion models, in
this work, we introduce RNADiffFold, an innovative generative prediction approach of RNA secondary structures based on multinomial
diffusion. We reconceptualize the prediction of contact maps as akin to pixel-wise segmentation and accordingly train a denoising
model to refine the contact maps starting from a noise-infused state progressively. We also devise a potent conditioning mechanism
that harnesses features extracted from RNA sequences to steer the model toward generating an accurate secondary structure. These
features encompass one-hot encoded sequences, probabilistic maps generated from a pre-trained scoring network, and embeddings
and attention maps derived from RNA foundation model. Experimental results on both within- and cross-family datasets demonstrate
RNADiffFold’s competitive performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, RNADiffFold has shown a
notable proficiency in capturing the dynamic aspects of RNA structures, a claim corroborated by its performance on datasets comprising
multiple conformations.

"Structure and
Dynamics of RNA","These excerpts from ""Structure and Dynamics of RNA"" present a comprehensive overview of RNA research as of 1986, stemming from a NATO Advanced Research Workshop. The text explores RNA's intricate three-dimensional architecture and its dynamic behavior through various biophysical techniques like NMR and spectroscopy. It investigates factors influencing RNA stability, such as base stacking and loop formation, and examines the conformations of RNA constituents. Several chapters focus on specific RNA types, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and viral RNA, detailing their structural features and functional roles, often employing methods like cross-linking and mutagenesis. The collection also addresses RNA synthesis using RNA polymerase and the interaction of RNA with proteins and other molecules. Collectively, these contributions illuminate the multifaceted nature of RNA structure and its importance in biological processes. Dynamics of RNA

This briefing document reviews the main themes and important ideas presented in the provided excerpts from ""Structure_and_Dynamics_of_RNA.pdf"". The document covers topics ranging from thermodynamic stability of RNA structures to anomalous conformations, dynamics studied by NMR, and structural features of various RNA molecules like tRNA and ribosomal RNA.
Main Themes and Important Ideas
1. Thermodynamics of RNA Structure Formation

    Free Energy Increments: The stability of RNA structures is governed by free energy changes associated with the addition of base pairs, dangling ends, and terminal phosphates. Figure 2 and Table 1 provide data on these increments for different core helices (GCG, GCGC, GGCC) at 37°C and in 1M NaCl.
    For example, Table 1 shows the free energy increment for adding a 5' dangling A to a GGCC core is -0.9 kcal/mol, while a 3' dangling A is -2.2 kcal/mol, indicating a stronger stabilizing effect for the 3' end.
    The free energy increment for forming a terminal CG base pair with a GGCC core is also provided.
    Nearest Neighbor Parameters: Revised nearest neighbor parameters are crucial for accurate prediction of RNA structure using computational methods like the Zuker and Stiegler program. The parameters in Table 3 (not shown in detail but referenced) were used to predict the structure of a self-splicing intervening sequence.
    Stability Increments: Table 1 details stability increments for various terminal additions (phosphates, dangling ends, base pairs, mismatches) to different core helices under specific ionic conditions. These parameters are derived from thermodynamic studies of oligonucleotide equilibria.

2. Anomalous Conformations and Stacking

    Helical Preference: Short single-stranded RNA fragments typically favor a right-handed helical conformation.
    Cornelis Altona states, ""Short single-stranded RNA fragments normally display a strong tendency to favour a right-handed helical conformation."" (p. 13)
    Stacking Interactions: Base-base stacking interactions are enthalpy-favorable but entropy-unfavorable, leading to a delicate balance that can be easily shifted by minor structural variations.
    ""This 'vertical' base-base interaction usually is accompanied by a large change of the enthalpy (-6Hstack ~ 5 to 7 kcal/mole per interaction in a single-helical array...)."" (p. 14)
    ""The extremely favourable enthalpy factor does not necessarily mean that nucleic acids are permanently locked into a base-stacked array, for at ambient temperature it is balanced by a counter factor: a large and unfavourable entropy term: - 65stack ~ 15 to 25 cal/mole/K."" (p. 14)
    Conformational Transmission: In trimers and higher oligomers, next-nearest-neighbor interactions can influence conformation. The behavior of U-A-U and A-U-A trimers highlights this, with A-U-A exhibiting a 1-3 stacking interaction and a ""bulge-out"" of the central pyrimidine.
    ""For example, the trimer U-A-U (A = m~A) behaves in a fashion that can be predicted from the known stacking proper­ ties of its dimer constituents U-A and A-U, whereas the trimer A-U-A behaves in an entirely different way. In the latter compound the two purines engage in a 1-3 stacking interaction. At the same time the central pyri­ midine residue is pushed outside the purine-purine interaction zone (bulge-out)."" (p. 13)
    Bulges: Bulged-out residues can disrupt normal stacking patterns and often prefer the S sugar conformation, unlike classical RNA helices that favor the N form.
    ""Bulged-out triplets share another characteristic property: compared to classical RNA helices, which invariably prefer to have the sugars adopt the N form (Table IV), the bulges definitely prefer S (Table V)."" (p. 14)
    Bulges can allow 3'-stacking but may impede 5'-stacking. Double bulges might indicate flexibility to adapt to conflicting structural demands.

3. NMR Spectroscopy in RNA Structure and Dynamics

    Backbone Geometry: NMR methods can determine sugar-phosphate backbone geometry by surveying dihedral angles (β, γ, δ, ε). Specific coupling constants (e.g., JH3',P, JC4'P, JC2'P) provide information about these angles.
    ""s(C4' - C3' - 03' - P). The conformational situation about s is usual­ ly given in terms of an equilibrium between two, distinctly non-classical, rotamers st and c, the s+ region appears 'forbidden'. Fig. 3C reveals that s can in principle be monitored by three couplings: J H3 ,P , JC4'P and J C2 'p."" (p. 14)
    Chemical Shifts: Differential shieldings of protons in RNA fragments provide insights into stacking and bulging phenomena (Tables II and III). Changes in chemical shifts with temperature can indicate the stability of stacked structures versus bulges. Bulged residues often show less temperature dependence in their chemical shifts.
    NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect): NOE measurements, including NOESY experiments, can determine interproton distances and provide information about the three-dimensional structure of RNA molecules. Short mixing times are crucial for larger molecules to avoid spin diffusion.
    ""In addition to providing assignments, NOE measurements can be used to determine interproton distances."" (p. 139)
    Equation [2] (not explicitly shown but referenced) is used to relate NOE intensities to interproton distances.
    Caution is advised regarding spin diffusion and the influence of nearby protons on distance determination. Internal references, like the H5-H6 base vector and H1'-H2' sugar vector, can help assess the reliability of distance estimates.
    Rotational Relaxation: Measurements of rotational relaxation times using fluorescence anisotropy decay (Table Z and Figure 5) provide information about the overall motion and local flexibility of RNA components like modified bases (e.g., deoxy-2-aminopurine, wybutine).

4. Structural Features of Specific RNAs

    tRNA: The structure of tRNA, including the anticodon loop and stem (Figure 3 on p. 143), is stabilized by stacking interactions and polar electrostatic interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations (pp. 151-154) can provide insights into the flexibility and dynamics of tRNA domains like the anticodon arm. Studies using chemical modification (DMS, DEPC, ENU) reveal the accessibility of specific bases and phosphates, providing information about secondary and tertiary structure (Figure 2 on p. 127). Comparisons between different tRNAs (e.g., tRNAAsp and tRNAPhe) highlight conserved and variable structural elements (Figures 1 and 2 on p. 113).
    Ribosomal RNA (rRNA):5S rRNA: Exhibits dynamic secondary structures with potential equilibria between different conformations (Figure 2 on p. 193). ""Compact"" and ""conventional"" models exist, suggesting that internal loops may be more complex structures, possibly involving bulges or symmetrical odd base pairs (Figure 3 on p. 195). Chemical and enzymatic probing (e.g., S1 nuclease digestion) reveals accessibility patterns that vary with temperature and can indicate dynamic regions (Figure 1 on p. 205, Table 1 on p. 207). Phylogenetic analyses and comparisons across different organisms (eukaryotes, eubacteria) highlight conserved and variable structural features (Tables 4-7 on pp. 210-216).
    23S rRNA: Chemical modification studies using diethyl pyrocarbonate and dimethyl sulphate under native and semi-denaturing conditions can identify accessible adenosines and cytidines in specific domains (Figure 1 on p. 224, Figure on p. 225). These data can be correlated with phylogenetic analyses to identify potentially functionally important sites.
    16S rRNA: The 3' end of 16S rRNA is implicated in forming a short double strand with mRNA (Shine-Dalgarno interaction), which can stimulate the binding of initiator tRNA to the 30S ribosome (Figure 3 on p. 279). Oligonucleotides containing the Shine-Dalgarno region and initiation codon can be used to study this interaction.
    Viroids and Virusoids: These small pathogenic RNAs exhibit characteristic secondary structures with varying degrees of base pairing and bifurcations (Table I and Figure on pp. 320-321). Thermodynamic parameters derived from experiments and calculations provide insights into their stability and structural transitions.

5. Chemical Modification as a Probe of RNA Structure

Various chemical reagents (e.g., bisulphite, dimethylsulphate, diethylpyrocarbonate, ethylnitrosourea, kethoxal) and nucleases are used to probe the accessibility of specific bases and phosphodiester bonds in RNA molecules under different conditions (native, semi-denatured). The pattern of modification or cleavage reveals information about base pairing, stacking, and tertiary interactions.
6. Computational Methods in RNA Structure Prediction

Computer programs (e.g., Zuker and Stiegler) utilize thermodynamic parameters (nearest neighbor rules, loop penalties) to predict RNA secondary structure and folding. Molecular mechanics calculations (e.g., using AMBER program) and molecular dynamics simulations can provide insights into RNA conformation, dynamics, and stability.

"NuFold: end-to-end approach for RNA
tertiary structure prediction with flexible
nucleobase center representation","RNA plays a crucial role not only in information transfer as messenger RNA
during gene expression but also in various biological functions as non-coding
RNAs. Understanding mechanical mechanisms of function needs tertiary

structure information; however, experimental determination of three-
dimensional RNA structures is costly and time-consuming, leading to a sub-
stantial gap between RNA sequence and structural data. To address this

challenge, we developed NuFold, a novel computational approach that
leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architecture to accurately predict RNA
tertiary structures. NuFold is a deep neural network trained end-to-end for the
output structure from the input sequence. NuFold incorporates a nucleobase
center representation, which enables flexible conformation of ribose rings.
Benchmark study showed that NuFold clearly outperformed energy-based
methods and demonstrated comparable results with existing state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based methods. NuFold exhibited a particular advantage in
building correct local geometries of RNA. Analyses of individual components
in the NuFold pipeline indicated that the performance improved by utilizing
metagenome sequences for multiple sequence alignment and increasing the

Physics-based de novo prediction of RNA 3D structures,"Current experiments on structural determination cannot keep up the pace with the steadily
emerging RNA sequences and new functions. This underscores the request for an accurate model
for RNA three-dimensional (3D) structural prediction. Although considerable progress has been
made in mechanistic studies, accurate prediction for RNA tertiary folding from sequence remains
an unsolved problem. The first and most important requirement for the prediction of RNA

structure from physical principles is an accurate free energy model. A recently developed three-
vector virtual bond-based RNA folding model (“Vfold”) has allowed us to compute the chain

entropy and predict folding free energies and structures for RNA secondary structures and simple
pseudoknots. Here we develop a free energy-based method to predict larger more complex RNA
tertiary folds. The approach is based on a multiscaling strategy: from the nucleotide sequence, we
predict the two-dimensional (2D) structures (defined by the base pairs and tertiary contacts); based
on the 2D structure, we construct a 3D scaffold; with the 3D scaffold as the initial state, we
combine AMBER energy minimization and PDB-based fragment search to predict the all-atom
structure. A key advantage of the approach is the statistical mechanical calculation for the
conformational entropy of RNA structures, including those with cross-linked loops. Benchmark
tests show that the model leads to significant improvements in RNA 3D structure prediction.

"RNA structuralmotifs: building blocks
of a modular biomolecule","Abstract. RNAs are modular biomolecules, composed largely of conserved structural
subunits, or motifs. These structural motifs comprise the secondary structure of RNA and are knit
together via tertiary interactions into a compact, functional, three-dimensional structure and are
to be distinguished from motifs defined by sequence or function. A relatively small number of
structural motifs are found repeatedly in RNA hairpin and internal loops, and are observed to be
composed of a limited number of common ‘ structural elements ’. In addition to secondary and
tertiary structure motifs, there are functional motifs specific for certain biological roles and binding
motifs that serve to complex metals or other ligands. Research is continuing into the identification
and classification of RNA structural motifs and is being initiated to predict motifs from sequence,
to trace their phylogenetic relationships and to use them as building blocks in RNA engineering.",RNA Structural Motifs; Modular RNA Architecture; Tertiary Interactions in RNA; Functional and Binding RNA Motifs; RNA Motif Engineering and Phylogenetics
"Mining for recurrent long-range interactions in RNA

pairs enables RNA molecules to assemble into so-
phisticated interaction networks, which are used to

"Interpretable RNA Foundation Model from Unannotated Data for
Highly Accurate RNA Structure and Function Predictions","Non-coding RNA structure and function are essential to understanding various biological processes, such
as cell signaling, gene expression, and post-transcriptional regulations. These are all among the core problems
in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount
of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited
numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for

predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior per-
formance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all

the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover
that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without

using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM’s effectiveness by applying it to the downstream sec-
ondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding

preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the
proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently.
Despite only being trained with unlabelled data, RNA-FM can serve as the foundational model for the field.",RNA Foundation Models; Self-supervised Learning for RNA; RNA Structural and Functional Prediction; Unannotated RNA Sequence Analysis; RNA Evolution and Protein-RNA Interaction Modeling
"Predicting RNA folding thermodynamics with a
reduced chain representation model","Based on the virtual bond representation for the nucleotide backbone, we develop a reduced conformational model for RNA.
We use the experimentally measured atomic coordinates to model the helices and use the self-avoiding walks in a diamond
lattice to model the loop conformations. The atomic coordinates of the helices and the lattice representation for the loops are
matched at the loop–helix junction, where steric viability is accounted for. Unlike the previous simplified lattice-based models,
the present virtual bond model can account for the atomic details of realistic three-dimensional RNA structures. Based on the
model, we develop a statistical mechanical theory for RNA folding energy landscapes and folding thermodynamics. Tests against
experiments show that the theory can give much more improved predictions for the native structures, the thermal denaturation
curves, and the equilibrium folding/unfolding pathways than the previous models. The application of the model to the P5abc
region of Tetrahymena group I ribozyme reveals the misfolded intermediates as well as the native-like intermediates in the
equilibrium folding process. Moreover, based on the free energy landscape analysis for each and every loop mutation, the model
predicts five lethal mutations that can completely alter the free energy landscape and the folding stability of the molecule.

"Geometric nomenclature and classification
of RNA base pairs","Non-Watson–Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA–RNA self-assembly and RNA–

protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping param-
eters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect

underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and com-
parison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge,

hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson–Crick edge, the

Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 29-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-
groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative

to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases.
For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of
11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group
of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups
on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates
the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition

of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are pro-
posed for displaying non-Watson–Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification

in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.

Physics-based RNA structure prediction,"Abstract Despite the success of RNA secondary structure prediction for simple, short RNAs, the problem of
predicting RNAs with long-range tertiary folds remains. Furthermore, RNA 3D structure prediction is

hampered by the lack of the knowledge about the tertiary contacts and their thermodynamic pa-
rameters. Low-resolution structural modeling enables us to estimate the conformational entropies for a

number of tertiary folds through rigorous statistical mechanical calculations. The models lead to 3D
tertiary folds at coarse-grained level. The coarse-grained structures serve as the initial structures for
all-atom molecular dynamics refinement to build the final all-atom 3D structures. In this paper, we
present an overview of RNA computational models for secondary and tertiary structures’ predictions
and then focus on a recently developed RNA statistical mechanical model—the Vfold model. The main
emphasis is placed on the physics behind the models, including the treatment of the non-canonical
interactions in secondary and tertiary structure modelings, and the correlations to RNA functions.

Date: October 26, 2023 Prepared for: [Your Intended Audience] Subject: Review of ""RNA_Structure_Prediction.pdf"" Excerpts

This briefing document summarizes the main themes and important ideas presented in the provided excerpts from ""RNA_Structure_Prediction.pdf"". The excerpts cover a broad range of topics within the field, including fundamental principles of RNA folding, computational methods for structure prediction (secondary and tertiary), analysis of structural changes due to sequence variations, evolutionary conservation of RNA structure, RNA-RNA interaction prediction, RNA-protein interaction analysis, experimental methods for structure determination, and computational tools for RNA 3D modeling and design.
Main Themes and Important Ideas:

1. Thermodynamic Basis of RNA Folding and Prediction:

    RNA structure formation is governed by free energy changes, with the probability of a specific structure being related to the exponential of its free energy change, as described by the Boltzmann distribution. The excerpt presents the formula: ""P ζ∈Ω xð Þ edG ζ,xð Þ=RT , where dG(ζ, x) is the free energy change of sequence x and structure ζ, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, andΩ(x) represents the set of all possible structures of sequence x.""
    Dynamic programming (DP) is a key technique for efficiently computing the free energy of RNA subsequences and subsequently the partition function and structure probabilities. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems.
    The nearest neighbor model is a widely used approach for modeling RNA secondary structures based on energy models. It decomposes structures into loop substructures enclosed by neighboring base pairs (hairpin loops, stacking, bulge loops, internal loops, multibranch loops, and external loops).
    Energy models utilize parameters derived from experimental data to estimate the free energy contributions of different structural elements, including base pairs, stacking interactions, loops, and dangling ends. The ""negative values of the Turner free energy parameter set [21]"" are specifically mentioned as being used in scoring models.
    Algorithms like Rfold and its derivatives (Raccess, ParasoR) utilize stochastic context-free grammars and thermodynamic folding models to analyze local RNA secondary structures, often employing a ""maximal span of base pairs to implement feasible structural analysis of long RNAs.""

2. Computational Methods for RNA Structure Prediction:

    The document highlights various algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction, including those based on energy minimization using dynamic programming (e.g., algorithms implementing the nearest neighbor model) and machine learning approaches (e.g., using structured support vector machines (SSVM) to integrate thermodynamic and machine learning models).
    Linear-time algorithms for RNA structure prediction (e.g., LinearFold, LinearPartition) are discussed as offering significant improvements in computational efficiency compared to traditional methods with higher time complexities (e.g., Vienna RNAfold, CONTRAfold). The excerpt provides performance comparisons showing that LinearFold-V and LinearFold-C have runtimes scaling roughly as ""~n1.2"" and ""~n1.1"", respectively, compared to Vienna RNAfold and CONTRAfold with ""~n2.4"" to ""~n3.0"" scaling.
    Algorithms for predicting RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots, such as LandscapeFold, are covered. LandscapeFold employs a direct enumeration of states approach, building structures by finding ""mutually compatible combinations of stems.""
    Methods for calculating base pairing probabilities are described, utilizing inside and outside variables in dynamic programming frameworks. The probability of a base pair (i, j) is given by ""pij ¼ ZB ij ñ bZB ij Z :"", where ZB ij and bZB ij are inside and outside variables, and Z is the partition function.

3. Analyzing the Impact of Sequence Variations on RNA Structure:

    The document addresses the prediction of RNA secondary structure alterations caused by single nucleotide variants (SNVs/SNPs). Tools like Radiam leverage the location-specific dependency of variables in algorithms like Rfold to efficiently recompute structure probabilities upon mutation.
    ParasoR is presented as a tool that uses the Radiam algorithm to analyze the impact of mutations on stem probabilities and compute empirical p-values to assess the significance of structural changes.
    The SSS-test is described as a method to evaluate the impact of indels (insertions/deletions) on non-coding RNA (ncRNA) structures by comparing the structural distance between a species' RNA and a family consensus, and by assessing the likelihood of observing the indel within a neutral model using rank statistics.

4. Evolutionary Conservation of RNA Secondary Structure:

    The evolutionary conservation of RNA secondary structure is discussed, with methods like the SSS-test being used to identify RNA regions under selection to maintain their structure.
    The concept of dominant bases in multiple sequence alignments and their role in identifying species-specific substitutions affecting RNA structure are mentioned.

5. Prediction of RNA-RNA Interactions (RRIs):

    Fast computational methods for predicting RNA-RNA interactions, particularly for transcriptome-scale datasets, are highlighted. Tools and web services dedicated to RRI prediction are mentioned.
    Specific examples like snoRNAs mediating RNA modification through base-pairing RRIs are provided.

6. Understanding RNA-Protein Interactions:

    Deep neural networks (DNNs), as implemented in ResidualBind, are used to uncover sequence-structure preferences of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
    Global importance analysis (GIA) is presented as a method to measure the population-level effect size of sequence features (like motifs) on RBP binding predictions. In silico mutagenesis is also mentioned as a powerful approach to highlight learned motif representations.

7. Experimental Methods for RNA Structure Determination:

    High-throughput structural analysis methods are mentioned in the context of RNA structure determination. (Details of specific methods are not elaborated in these excerpts).

8. RNA 3D Modeling and Design:

    Tools for RNA 3D modeling, such as FARFAR2 (available online), are mentioned.
    RNAMake is introduced as a software package for the automated 3D design and evaluation of RNA nanostructures. It utilizes a motif dictionary and pathfinding algorithms to assemble RNA motifs into desired 3D architectures.
    RNAMake has been used for various design challenges, including aligning parts of the tetraloop/tetra-loop receptor, building tethers in ribosomes, and improving aptamer binding properties.
    The software includes a Monte Carlo design algorithm and the ability to estimate the thermodynamic contribution of helical elements in RNA 3D structures.

9. Metrics for RNA Structure Comparison and Evaluation:

    Metrics for comparing and assessing discrepancies between RNA 3D structures and models are discussed, referencing studies [83, 84] and tools like the RNA-puzzles toolkit.
    For secondary structure comparison, Sensitivity (SEN), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and F-value are defined as common evaluation metrics based on correctly (TP) and incorrectly (FP, FN) predicted base pairs.
    The RNA-Puzzles toolkit includes tools for calculating all-atom Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) and interaction network fidelity (INF) to compare predicted and reference 3D structures.

"RNA secondary structure prediction using an
ensemble of two-dimensional deep neural
networks and transfer learning","The majority of our human genome transcribes into noncoding RNAs with unknown struc-
tures and functions. Obtaining functional clues for noncoding RNAs requires accurate base-
pairing or secondary-structure prediction. However, the performance of such predictions by

current folding-based algorithms has been stagnated for more than a decade. Here, we

propose the use of deep contextual learning for base-pair prediction including those non-
canonical and non-nested (pseudoknot) base pairs stabilized by tertiary interactions. Since

only <250 nonredundant, high-resolution RNA structures are available for model training, we
utilize transfer learning from a model initially trained with a recent high-quality bpRNA
dataset of >10,000 nonredundant RNAs made available through comparative analysis.
The resulting method achieves large, statistically significant improvement in predicting all
base pairs, noncanonical and non-nested base pairs in particular. The proposed method
(SPOT-RNA), with a freely available server and standalone software, should be useful for
improving RNA structure modeling, sequence alignment, and functional annotations.",RNA Secondary Structure Prediction; Deep Neural Network Ensemble Methods; Transfer Learning in RNA; Non-Canonical and Pseudoknot Structure Modeling; RNA Functional Annotation
"RNA-Puzzles Round IV: 3D structure predictions of four
ribozymes and two aptamers","RNA-Puzzles is a collective endeavor dedicated to the advancement and improvement of RNA 3D structure prediction.
With agreement from crystallographers, the RNA structures are predicted by various groups before the publication of
the crystal structures. We now report the prediction of 3D structures for six RNA sequences: four nucleolytic ribozymes
and two riboswitches. Systematic protocols for comparing models and crystal structures are described and analyzed. In
these six puzzles, we discuss (i) the comparison between the automated web servers and human experts; (ii) the prediction
of coaxial stacking; (iii) the prediction of structural details and ligand binding; (iv) the development of novel prediction
methods; and (v) the potential improvements to be made. We show that correct prediction of coaxial stacking and tertiary
contacts is essential for the prediction of RNA architecture, while ligand binding modes can only be predicted with low

resolution and simultaneous prediction of RNA structure with accurate ligand binding still remains out of reach. All the pre-
dicted models are available for the future development of force field parameters and the improvement of comparison and

assessment tools.

"Accurate structure prediction of
biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3","The introduction of AlphaFold 21

has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure
of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein
modelling and design2–6

. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially
updated difusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure
of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modifed
residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy
over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand
interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy
for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specifc predictors
and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with
AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8

. Together, these results show that high-accuracy
modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unifed deep-learning
framework.",Biomolecular Interaction Prediction; AlphaFold-based Structure Modeling; Protein–Nucleic Acid Interaction Modeling; Protein–Ligand and Antibody–Antigen Predictions; Unified Deep Learning Approaches
"Automated classification of RNA 3D motifs
and the RNA 3D Motif Atlas","The analysis of atomic-resolution RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures reveals that many internal and hairpin loops are
modular, recurrent, and structured by conserved non-Watson–Crick base pairs. Structurally similar loops define RNA 3D
motifs that are conserved in homologous RNA molecules, but can also occur at nonhomologous sites in diverse RNAs, and
which often vary in sequence. To further our understanding of RNA motif structure and sequence variability and to provide
a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction, we present a new method for automated classification of internal
and hairpin loop RNA 3D motifs and a new online database called the RNA 3D Motif Atlas. To classify the motif instances,
a representative set of internal and hairpin loops is automatically extracted from a nonredundant list of RNA-containing
PDB files. Their structures are compared geometrically, all-against-all, using the FR3D program suite. The loops are clustered
into motif groups, taking into account geometric similarity and structural annotations and making allowance for a variable
number of bulged bases. The automated procedure that we have implemented identifies all hairpin and internal loop
motifs previously described in the literature. All motif instances and motif groups are assigned unique and stable identifiers
and are made available in the RNA 3D Motif Atlas (http://rna.bgsu.edu/motifs), which is automatically updated every four
weeks. The RNA 3D Motif Atlas provides an interactive user interface for exploring motif diversity and tools for programmatic
data access.

"Deep learning models for predicting RNA
degradation via dual crowdsourcing","Solution descriptions from Kaggle teams
1st Place - Jiayang Gao (also called ""Nullrecurrent"" model)
My final submission is a simple ensemble of 4 models, each starts with an auto-encoder pretrained GNN
architecture, followed by LSTM, GRU or Wavenet layers. My model takes in two kinds of features, (1)
1D features with length n (the length of the mRNA sequence), representing features at each location of
the sequence; (2) 2D features with size n^2, representing ""distance"" or ""relationship"" concepts between
each pair. The strongest 1D features are the distance to the closest paired position, as well as the distance
to the closest unpaired position - reactivity increases as the distance to the closest paired position becomes
larger. The strongest 2D feature is the distance between each pair in the primary pairing based graph - this
allows the model to capture the ""neighbors"" caused by pairing. One major difficulty of this problem is
generalizing the model to different sequence lengths, and I use a semi-supervised approach to make my
model more generalizable. In particular, I randomly generate sequences of different length, calculate their
BPP matrix and pairing structure using the Arnie library, pseudo label their targets, and train them
together with the original train dataset. This semi-supervised learning approach is particularly useful in
this problem, for which sample size is small and labeled data is expensive to obtain.

2nd Place - Kazuki ** 2 (also called ""Kazuki2"" model)
The mRNA sequence is not just a linear series of data, but also constitutes a loop by pairing between
specific bases. Therefore, we thought of constructing LSTM/GRU and GNN independently, and
integrating the prediction results with XGBoost. The base pair probabilities (bpps) are calculated by
prediction, and the calculation results differ depending on the algorithm used. Therefore, we used several
algorithms in Arnie to predict base pairs, and used these algorithms as data augmentation and input
multiple bpps simultaneously to improve the performance. We prepared 38 LSTM/GRU-based and 49
GNN-based bpps by changing the types of bpps and their architectures, and integrated them with
XGBoost to help improve the stability of prediction. Also, since the sequences in the test set tended to be
longer than those in the training data, we confirmed in preliminary experiments that the model trained by
shortening the sequences in the training data (107 to 88) was applicable to sequences of the original
length (107).

3rd Place - Striderl
My solution is an ensemble of various models of different structures and different training techniques. I
added various LSTM/GRU/wavenet layers at the end of the AE pretrained GNN structure, in which 2 x
128 units of LSTM or GRU layers work the best for me. Besides the common features used by other
teams like structure adjacency matrix and neighbor adjacency matrix, I used RNAComposer to generate
3D structures for each sample in the competition, and used predicted 3D distance to form the distance
matrix. I used Arnie to predict other possible base pairs as data augmentation. Besides, another
augmentation I used was to reverse the sequence and targets. The two augmentations quadruple the size
of the original data. I also used pseudo labeling technique to iteratively improve my best single model.
4th Place - FromTheWheel & Dyed & StoneShop
The 4th place solution is a blend of 4 different models, in which the RNN layers were varied
(LSTM+LSTM, LSTM+GRU, GRU+LSTM and GRU+GRU). We represent the RNA sequences as
graphs where each base corresponds to a node. The network then learns a representation for each of these
graphs and passes this representation through bi-directional RNN layers to obtain a sequence of predicted
targets. Both the edge and node features were derived from the given sequence and provided Base Pairing
Probability (BPP) matrix. One-hot-encoded bases (A, G, C, or U), one-hot-encoded positional feature (the
remainder of the base index divided by 3), one-hot-encoded loop types, loop type probabilities (CapR)

and BPP sum and number of zero's were beneficial node features. The distances (manhattan) between
bases, normalized by sequence length and whether there is a base-pairing indicated in the structure were
used as edge features. All these features were also inferred for newly generated BPP matrices, generated
with 6 libraries available within the ARNIE software package. The new information derived from the
CONTRAfold library was the most useful for this task, followed by RNAsoft, RNAstructure and Vienna.
We also tried to use 3D angle information (binned and then categorically encoded) extracted with
AMIGOS: this boosted our simple LSTM architecture used to fast check the feature importance but
deteriorated the performance of our final model.
5th Place - tito
My solution is a simple ensemble of GNN-based model and GRU/LSTM-based model. The features are
not significantly different from those used by the other teams. I focused mainly on augmentation. (1) I
used eternafold, vienna, nupack, contrafold and rnasoft to extract structure and loop_type. These backend
engines are used to extract additional bpps too. Especially eternafold and contrafold worked well. (2) In
this competition, the sequence length of the test data was longer than that of the training data, so we
added a dummy sequence to the training data. (3) I added reversed sequence to training data. I think
augmentation was important in this competition.
6th Place - nyanp
The data in this competition is very unique in two ways: 1) the sequence length is different between the
training data and the private test data, and 2) the sequence has long-term dependencies via pairing. My
NN model is constructed by stacking 1D SE-ResNet Layer and Graph Convolution Layer in order to
make the model invariant to sequence length and to capture the long-term dependency. The Graph
Convolution Layer is computed by a simple sum of products of the BPP matrix or adjacency matrix and
the sequence feature vector. The best single model was ranked 42nd (0.35045) on the private leaderboard,
while it was 513th (0.24371) on the public leaderboard. This indicates that my model is more robust to
changes in sequence length compared to the other participants. Best ensemble achieved MSRMSE's of
0.23069/0.34538 on the public/private leaderboard by combining 4 different architectures.

7th Place - One architecture
Main features for my solution used were base pairing probability matrix, nucleotide sequence, structure,
and loop type. Additionally, an inverse distance matrix (nucleotides at position i and j have distance |i-j|

between them) was added to the base pairing probability matrix before inputting it as a bias for the self-
attention matrix. The conventional type of positional encoding as detailed in the original transformer or

learnable positional encoding were not used; instead, position was encoded by the inverse distance matrix.
Further, 5 secondary structure packages were used to generate pairing probability matrix, structure, and
loop type at 37 and 50 C, resulting in 10 sets of features for each sequence. The architecture used was
almost identical to bert aside from the 1D/2D convolution/deconvolution layers (without padding). The
core module (ConvTransformerEncoder) was constructed as follows: (1) 1D convolution on the sequence
of encodings and 2D convolution on the bpp feature map. (2) self-attention with bpp feature map as
additive bias (3) position wise feedforward network. (4) 1D deconvolution on the sequence of encodings
and 2D deconvolution on the bpp feature map. All available sequences were used to pretrain
(unsupervised) models on randomly mutated or masked (with NULL token) sequence retrieval loss
(basically just softmax to retrieve correct nucleotide/structure/loop). For convenience, two linear decoders
were initialized before pretraining, one for sequence retrieval, and another for degradation predictions
later on. The Ranger optimizer was used with a flat and anneal schedule. Some sequences were excluded
during training on degradation targets based on signal to noise threshold (0.25, 0.5, or 1). My biggest
discovery from this competition is that the vanilla positional encoding used in the original transformer
paper does not generalize well to this task at least. It seems that the type of positional encoding used in

most transformers does not adequately describe the concept of position, which is fine for NLP because I
believe order and position of words are not as important as for RNA. The vanilla positional encoding is
more of an absolute positional encoding, whereas the inverse distance basically encoders relative position
in a very simple way that generalized better to longer sequences. Best ensemble achieved MSRMSE's of
0.23056/0.34550 on the public/private leaderboard.
8th Place - ishikei
My solution is an ensemble of GRU/LSTM and GNN. Each model is AE pretrained with all data. For
features, bpps was augmented with different temperature parameters (T=37, 50) using the ARNIE
package (vienna, nupack, rnastructure, rnasoft, eternafold, contrafold). I also added the shannon entropy
at each base position. Because all of the data in this competition are predicted values except for the
sequence, I think it would have been effective to use an ensemble of bpps predictions from various
algorithms. At high temperature: Since the secondary structure of RNA is temperature-dependent, I think
it was effective to use bpps with T changed as input. At high pH: Alkaline hydrolysis of RNA can occur
at any position in the sequence (probably) as well, so I think the prediction itself is difficult.

9th Place - Keep going to be GM
The big issue of this contest is that the train and test RNA sequence lengths are different, and the data
contains noise. The RNA sequence length used for training was 107, and the final ranking was obtained
for 130 sequences. Different models with fluent feature engineering to enhance the generalization of
predictions. Because RNA can have both graph and sequence, traditional recurrent neural networks
(LSTM, GRU), transformer and graph-neural networks were applied. For feature engineering, (A, G, C,
or U) were represented by embedding layers. And, various (N, N) adjacency matrices called bpps, which
are probabilities of being linked between nucleotides are calculated with various softwares, such as
CONTRAFold, RNAFold. The statistical features such as ratio of (A, G, C, or U) in sequence are added.
has are also included.I created the (N, N) matrix for fixed attention in various ways. Bpps was created
using several packages. The distance matrix was augmented using gaussian. With these features, dozens
of models were created by differing hyperparameters of sequential blocks and graph convolution layers.

11th Place - Social Distancing Please
Our solution is an ensemble of multiple models. There are mainly 2 types of models. The first type is a
combination of 1D Convolution Layers, Graph Convolution Layers, and RNN Layers. The second type is
a combination of WaveNet layers and RNN Layers. The most powerful features are the adjacency
matrices constructed by the given structure sequence and the given base-pair probabilities. The adjacency
matrices are used for the Graph Convolution Layers. Another useful trick we have used is to apply a
lower training weight to the top 6 sequence position, it is because the sequence start is similar across the
different sequences. We also used 2 different Linear Regression models to ensemble the predictions in
different sequence positions that are seqpos[:6] and seqpos[6:].
13th Place - The Machine
The main idea behind our approach is generating bpp matrices from all the libraries included in Arnie,
training a model from the output structures of each library and finally creating an ensemble of all the
trained models. Although each library provides sub optimal bpp, their consensus provides a better
solution. We also included several architectures in the ensemble and the best of them consisted of 1D
convolution, static graph convolution and bi-directional LSTM layers. A static graph convolution layer
processes each two connected nucleotides in the predicted secondary structure (zeros added when a
nucleotide isn't connected). All our models were trained on all the data using self supervised learning then
fine-tuned on the training data only using supervised learning.",RNA Degradation Prediction; Graph Neural Networks (GNNs); Deep Learning Ensemble Methods; Base-Pair Probability Modeling; Data Augmentation and Crowdsourced Modeling
Frequency and isostericity of RNA base pairs,"Most of the hairpin, internal and junction loops that
appear single-stranded in standard RNA secondary

structures form recurrent 3D motifs, where non-
Watson–Crick base pairs play a central role. Non-
Watson–Crick base pairs also play crucial roles in

tertiary contacts in structured RNA molecules. We
previously classified RNA base pairs geometrically
so as to group together those base pairs that are
structurally similar (isosteric) and therefore able to

substitute for each other by mutation without dis-
rupting the 3D structure. Here, we introduce a quan-
titative measure of base pair isostericity, the

IsoDiscrepancy Index (IDI), to more accurately

determine which base pair substitutions can poten-
tially occur in conserved motifs. We extract and

classify base pairs from a reduced-redundancy set
of RNA 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) and calculate centroids (exemplars) for each
base combination and geometric base pair type
(family). We use the exemplars and IDI values to
update our online Basepair Catalog and the
Isostericity Matrices (IM) for each base pair family.
From the database of base pairs observed in 3D

structures we derive base pair occurrence frequen-
cies for each of the 12 geometric base pair families.

In order to improve the statistics from the 3D struc-
tures, we also derive base pair occurrence frequen-
cies from rRNA sequence alignments.",RNA Base-Pair Isostericity; RNA Structural Motifs; Quantitative Structural Analysis; Geometric Classification of Base Pairs; Base Pair Frequency Analysis
"Assessment of three-dimensional
RNA structure prediction in CASP15","The prediction of RNA three-dimensional structures remains an unsolved problem. Here, we
report assessments of RNA structure predictions in CASP15, the first CASP exercise that
involved RNA structure modeling. Forty two predictor groups submitted models for at least one
of twelve RNA-containing targets. These models were evaluated by the RNA-Puzzles
organizers and, separately, by a CASP-recruited team using metrics (GDT, lDDT) and
approaches (Z-score rankings) initially developed for assessment of proteins and generalized
here for RNA assessment. The two assessments independently ranked the same predictor
groups as first (AIchemy_RNA2), second (Chen), and third (RNAPolis and GeneSilico, tied);
predictions from deep learning approaches were significantly worse than these top ranked
groups, which did not use deep learning. Further analyses based on direct comparison of
predicted models to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps and X-ray diffraction data
support these rankings. With the exception of two RNA-protein complexes, models submitted by
CASP15 groups correctly predicted the global fold of the RNA targets. Comparisons of CASP15
submissions to designed RNA nanostructures as well as molecular replacement trials highlight
the potential utility of current RNA modeling approaches for RNA nanotechnology and structural

biology, respectively. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling fine details such as non-
canonical pairs, in ranking among submitted models, and in prediction of multiple structures

resolved by cryo-EM or crystallography.",RNA 3D Structure Prediction; CASP15 RNA Assessment; RNA-Puzzles Structural Metrics; Comparative Analysis of RNA Modeling Methods; RNA Nanostructure and Structural Biology Applications
"Deep learning models for predicting RNA
degradation via dual crowdsourcing","Medicines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) hold immense potential,
as evidenced by their rapid deployment as COVID-19 vaccines. However,
worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their
thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of
RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis.
Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing
more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced
machine learning competition (‘Stanford OpenVaccine’) on Kaggle,
involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6,043 diverse
102–130-nucleotide RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through
crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment
was completed in less than 6 months, and 41% of nucleotide-level predictions
from the winning model were within experimental error of the ground
truth measurement. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly
predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules
(504–1,588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy compared with previously
published models. These results indicate that such models can represent
in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing
stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two crowdsourcing platforms,
one for dataset creation and another for machine learning, may be fruitful for
other urgent problems that demand scientifc discovery on rapid timescales.",RNA Degradation Prediction; Crowdsourced Data for RNA Stability; Machine Learning Benchmarking; Nucleotide-level Predictions; mRNA Vaccine Stability Optimization

"Broadly applicable and accurate protein design by integrating

methods1–9. Despite this progress, a general deep learning framework for protein design that
enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and
design of higher order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11
have had considerable success in image and language generative modeling but limited success
when applied to protein modeling, likely due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry
and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine tuning the RoseTTAFold
