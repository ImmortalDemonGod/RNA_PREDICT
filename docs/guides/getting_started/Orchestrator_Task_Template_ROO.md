# Orchestrator Task Template

**1. Immediate Priority & Scope:**
The immediate priority is to **[Clearly state the primary goal for this interaction, e.g., "address all actionable CodeRabbit feedback provided below", "complete Task [Task_ID] from the task management system", "implement the basic structure for the [Module/Class Name] module"]**. All subsequent actions in this current phase must focus solely on achieving this priority.

**2. Contextual Review:**
To begin, thoroughly review project documentation (paying close attention to **[Specify relevant documents, e.g., `docs/pseudocode.md`, `scripts/prd.txt`, `README.md`]**) and meticulously examine relevant code files (such as **[Specify relevant files/dirs, e.g., `src/[module_name].py`, `tests/`, `run-task-master.bat`]**) **specifically to gather the context needed for the stated priority**. Take brief notes for reference.

**3. Task System Interaction (Optional but Recommended):**
[Optional: If using TaskMaster and the Task ID is known] Access the project task management system by running **`[Command to view specific task, e.g., .\run-task-master.bat show [Task_ID]]`** to confirm the detailed requirements and status of the current priority task: **[Task_ID / Name]**.

**4. Scoped Decomposition:**
Based on the review and the requirements of the immediate priority, decompose **only the work needed to achieve this priority** into granular, manageable sub-tasks. Establish a systematic and logical workflow *for these sub-tasks only*.

**5. Delegation:**
For each sub-task identified, utilize the most appropriate specialized mode (e.g., 'code', 'architect') via the `new_task` tool. Provide clear, specific instructions and well-defined acceptance criteria for each delegated task. [Optional: If providing context below, add: "Ensure the delegated tasks explicitly reference and address the relevant items from the context provided below."]

**6. Autonomy & Constraints:**
Operate with autonomy **within the defined scope of completing [Restate the immediate priority/Task ID]**. User approval for decisions *within this scope* is pre-granted. **Do not** initiate decomposition or delegation for other features, tasks, or general improvements beyond this immediate priority until explicitly instructed.

**7. Supporting Context (If Applicable):**

[Context specific to the immediate priority, e.g., CodeRabbit Comments, specific requirements, error logs]
